  The Commission welcomes the Administration Committee's report on Catering and Retail Services in the House of Commons and is grateful to the Committee for its work. The Commission agrees with most of the recommendations, including all those which the Management Board has recommended be accepted. It has asked that the remainder be discussed with the Committee by officials of the House Service, after which the Commission will consider them again. That is expected to be in September.</p>

             <b>John Thurso:</b>
  The development of a smartphone application, designed primarily for those visiting Parliament, has been halted. The quotes received from the procurement exercise were too expensive and it has been decided not to continue at this stage. Further work will be undertaken in due course to explore a more cost-effective method of providing visitor information via smartphones.</p>
