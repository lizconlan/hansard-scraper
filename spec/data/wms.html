             <b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Mr Crispin Blunt):</b>
Today is the launch of a consultation on the “Strategy for the Secure Estate for Children and Young People for England and Wales”.</p>

             <a class="anchor" name="11071985000591"> </a>This is a joint publication between the Ministry of Justice and the Youth Justice Board. The consultation invites views on a proposed strategy for the under-18 secure estate for the years 2011-12 to 2014-15. Custody continues to play an important part in the youth justice system for the small number of young people for whom a community sentence is not appropriate. The recent reduction in the number of young people in custody means that the secure estate is now going through a period of change. This presents an opportunity to consider the most appropriate configuration of the estate and consider whether different regimes can deliver improved outcomes.</p>
